## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for the "Air Traffic Project - Part 1 - Data Analysis in SQL," completed as part of the BrainStation Data Science Education program. The project aims to provide actionable insights to the fund managers of the BrainStation Mutual Fund regarding investment decisions in major airline stocks. 

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several sections:

### Data Analysis in SQL

1. **Basic Details Analysis**: 
   - Obtaining basic information about the flight data, including the total number of flights in 2018 and 2019, the number of flights cancelled or departed late, and the reasons for flight cancellations.

2. **Year-over-Year Analysis**:
   - Comparing the total miles traveled and number of flights for each airline in 2018 and 2019 to determine the percent change in total flights and miles traveled for each airline.

3. **Destination Airports Analysis**:
   - Identifying the top 10 most popular destination airports overall and comparing results using different aggregation methods to optimize query runtime.

4. **Operating Costs Analysis**:
   - Analyzing the number of unique aircrafts operated and calculating the average distance traveled per aircraft to estimate operating costs for each airline.

5. **On-Time Performance Analysis**:
   - Examining on-time performance metrics, including average departure delay across different times of the day and for each airport and time-of-day combination.

## How to Use
